# Hey-Day-Bonus-Project
Hey Day is an Auburn tradition meant to help students feel welcomed and make new friends on Auburn's campus. This
script exists to continue that tradition into the digital age. To use this script just input your name when prompted
and your computer will tell you "Hey!" just like your new friends will on October 16th!

To learn more about the history and festivities that will take place on Hey Day, visit https://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/

Thank you and War Eagle!
